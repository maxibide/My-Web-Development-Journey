# Background
I am a Pharmacist and I have a PhD in food science and technology. I've been always interested in technology and computer programming in particular. Through the years I read and played with code a bit, but it was in 2019 that I decided that I wanted to learn programming in a more systematic way. I took some time to research and found that Full Stack Web Development was one of the most active areas in computer programming and the one that had the best resources to study from.

First, I started with the [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum and completed the first two certificates. However, I felt that I was lacking some theorical knowledge. That's when I found [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com), another online free web development course that had more organized links to reading material and videos. I found that the two courses complement each other very well, one with a more practical aproach, and the other digging deeper into concepts. That's why I decided to take both at the same time.

So, here I will document the progress and all the projects I make in this journey.

# Progress

* [Feb 2019 - Feb 2020]: Through Feb - Jul 2019 I made the first two certificates in freeCodeCamp. Life got a bit rough with my postdoctoral research and I stalled in progress. When finnaly I could get back, I found that I was lacking the deep understating I was looking for. So, I found The Odin Project and slowly started to go through Web Development 101.

* [May 2020]: Locked down in my house. With no postdoctoral research possible and all my work in the University going online, I spend most of my time in front of the computer screen. Good time to restart my web development journey. I made my own curriculum mixing The Odin Project's with freeCodecamp's.

* [June 2020]: And here we go again. I am reviewing all my knowledge in **HTML5** and **CSS3**. I will review the Responsive Web Design projects from freeCodeCamp and take the whole course of HTML and CSS in The Odin Project.

* [July 22, 2020]: Well, crazy month. Still locked down in my home and way too much work to do. However, I still managed to advance through the Odin Project's HTML and CSS course and today I finished the Embedding Images and Video Project. It was a fun project to do, and it completely reinforced my idea that doing is learning. I hope I can finish this course by next month.

* [04 September, 2020]: I keep moving slower than I expected (I am going to be a dad again this month and the preparations take a long time), but the important thing is that I keep going. I finished the HTML forms project. I felt very comfortable doing it, it shows that I am gaining practice and above all it is noticeable in the time it took me to do it, a third than the average time of previous projects.

* [17 February, 2021]: I'm back. After the birth of my daughter the house was a bit chaotic, but we are finally adjusting and I am again finding space to continue studying. I just finished the *New York Times article Project*. It helped me get a lot more comfortable with CSS Grid and Flexbox. It was an interesting experience and it also had the plus that I love cosmology, so at first I took the time to read the full article. Now I have an idea, is our universe a *flex-item* in a multiverse *flex container*? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

* [22 February, 2021]: Apple Homepage project done. I thought that it was going to be a simple and short project, but, oh, that navbar was tricky to do :sweat_smile:

* [15 March, 2021]: Design Teardown project done. Again, another project that at first glance seemed simple and *easy*. But of course, *simple* and *easy* are two very different things. Lesson learnt. I am not a very visual person, so this one took time, but now I have a better insight on what it takes to make a good visual hierarchy, and in turn, a better UX.

* [03 April, 2021]: Building with Responsive Design project done. The project was to clone the homepage of [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com). I believe that was the most complex project I have done to date. I tried to clone most of the details of the original webpage and learnt quite a bit in the process. For example, I had to learn how to create dropdown menues using only CSS. And also I had to use everything I've learned before, such as positioning, FlexBox and CSS Grid. I didn't encounter major difficulties to do it, but it took me a lot of time to do it thoroughly. All in all it was a very fun project to do.

* [25 May, 2021]: I finished the project of designing a webpage with Bootstrap. The project consisted of cloning the main page of [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com) using mainly Bootstrap. It was a project that took me a long time, especially since I had to dig a lot into this Framework and solve some thorny issues, such as the issue of the order of the sections according to screen size. But in the end the feeling is very rewarding.

* [22 June, 2021]: Finally! With the Design Your Own Grid-Based Framework project in Sass I have finished the HTML & CSS course in **The Odin Project**. In **freeCodeCamp** I had already finished it two years ago. I still have a lot of details to learn, but I think I finished the course with a much deeper understanding of HTML and CSS, and especially technologies like Bootstrap and Sass. Now comes the most interesting part: here we go JavaScript!
