# Calculator

A simple calculator made with HTML, CSS and JS as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) Foundations course. The app tries to capture the functionality of a simple handheld calculator.

## Introspection

I made this Javascript application following my own approach, so I only allowed myself to look for help online when I was in doubt about the syntax of the language, but I designed the algorithm on my own. It was a fun process and in the end, the code, for better or for worse, turned out to be different from the rest of the solutions.

The heart of the app is an objet named `input`. This object has a property to store the input made by the user and several methods to handle how this input is processed, operated and displayed.
