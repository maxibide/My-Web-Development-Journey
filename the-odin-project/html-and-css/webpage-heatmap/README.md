# Project: Design Teardown

This is a simple project to break apart a website, in this case the [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) homepage, in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles. That was done by creating a grayscale heat mapof the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. 

The website heatmap was built using only HTML5 and CSS3 as part of the [HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css) course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Reflection

While simple, I found this project a bit more difficult than anticipated. That was probably because this was the first project that involved not cloning the look of a certain webpage but dissecting it in a more profound way. It was not about *copying* the look but *understanding* how and why the page was designed as it was. It was an interesting exercise, and one that took time.
