# Project: Apple Homepage

This is a replica of the [Apple Homepage as it was in March 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) built using only HTML5 and CSS3 as part of the [HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css) course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The purpose of this project was to practice the use of CSS backgrounds and gradients and get the general look of the original page.

## Reflection

The top navbar was by far the most challenging part of this project. The background was made by overlaying a linear top-to-bottom gradient and a radial gradient to get the subtle center-to-side gradient observed in both the right and left sides of the bar. The logo and text to the buttons were added exactly as in the original, using a single svg image that contains the labels and shifting the background for each button to coincide with the corresponding label. A gradient border and box shadows were added to complete the look of the bar. Finally, the animation of the search form was achieved by using pseudo-classes and a simple transition.

The layout of the page was done with tools learnt on past lessons, mainly Flexbox.
