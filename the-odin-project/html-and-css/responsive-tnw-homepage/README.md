# Project: Building with Responsive Design

This is a replica of the homepage of [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com) built using only HTML5 and CSS3 as part of the [HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css) course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The purpose of this project was to build a responsive website using media queries.

## Live Demo

## Reflection

This is quite a complex webpage. The main layout was done using FlexBox and CSS Grid and media queries were used to gracefully degrade the site as the windows size is reduced. CSS transitions and selectively hiding elements with `display: none` was used to modify the location of the logo and the header layout according to the windows width.
