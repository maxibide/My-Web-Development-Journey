        <li> <strong>1889</strong> - He is introduced to a family friend called Max Talmud who introduced the boy to books on science and mathematics. Albert starts his quest for facts and information available about the sciences. He attends the
          Luitpold-Gymnasium
          in Munich for the next six years.
        <li> <strong>1894</strong> - Due to financial reasons the Einstein family move from Munich to Pavia, Italy. Albert is left in Munich to finish his studies but soon decides to follow the family to Italy
        <li> <strong>1895</strong> - He is sent to the Swiss town of Aarau to finish high school.
        <li> <strong>1896</strong> - Albert graduates from high school at the age of 17 and enrols at the ETH (the Federal Polytechnic) in Zurich. He renounces his German citizenship.
        <li> <strong>1898</strong> - Albert meets and falls in love with Mileva Maric, a Hungarian classmate at the ETH.
        <li> <strong>1900</strong> - Einstein graduates in 1900 from ETH with a degree in physics.
        <li> <strong>1901</strong> - He completes his first scientific paper on the capillary forces of a straw. Mileva becomes pregnant and moves to live with her parents in to Hungary to give birth to their baby. Albert moves to Bern.
        <li> <strong>1902</strong> - Einstein and Mileva have a daughter called Lieserl Einstein who is later given up for adoption. Albert takes a job at the Swiss Patent Office.

        <li> <strong>1905</strong> - Einstein's <i>Annus mirabilis</i>. His Special Theory of Relativity is born and he applies his theory to mass and energy and formulates the famous equation e=mc2. Einstein has four papers published
          in the Annalen der Physik, the leading German physics journal.
        <li> <strong>1907</strong> - Einstein begins applying the laws of gravity to his Special Theory of Relativity.
        <li> <strong>1908</strong> - Albert Einstein becomes a privatdozent (an associate professorship) at the University of Bern.
        <li> <strong>1909</strong> - He resigns from Patent Office and is appointed Associate Professor of theoretical physics at Zurich University.
        <li> <strong>1910</strong> -Albert and Mileva's second son, Eduard, is born in Munich. He writes a paper on critical opalescence that described why the sky is blue.
        <li> <strong>1911</strong> - Einstein predicts bending of light. He is appointed Professor of theoretical physics at the German University .of Prague.
        <li> <strong>1913</strong> - He is appointed Professor of theoretical physics at the Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich and works on his new Theory of Gravity.
        <li> <strong>1914</strong> - Albert and Mileva separate and live apart. Einstein is appointed Professor at University of Berlin. WW1 begins and Einstein signs anti-war "Manifesto to Europeans".
        <li> <strong>1915</strong> - Einstein completes the General Theory of Relativity. He joins the "New Fatherland League" a pacifist organisation.
        <li> <strong>1916</strong> - His General Theory of Relativity is published.
        <li> <strong>1917</strong> - Einstein writes his first paper on cosmology. He is Appointed Director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin.
        <li> <strong>1919</strong> - Einstein and Mileva divorce and Einstein marries his cousin Elsa. A solar eclipse proves Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
        <li> <strong>1921</strong> - Einstein visits to the U.S. and lectures at Princeton University on theory of relativity.
        <li> <strong>1922</strong> - Albert Einstein is awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for 1921.
        <li> <strong>1927</strong> - He begins to develop the foundation of quantum mechanics with Niels Bohr.
        <li> <strong>1933</strong> - Einstein leaves Germany and emigrates to U.S. in September and settles in Princeton, New Jersey where he assumes a post at the Institute for Advanced Study.
        <li> <strong>1934</strong> - The World As I See It published.

        <li> <strong>1939</strong> - World War 2 starts and Albert Einstein warns President Roosevelt that Germany might build an atomic bomb. He then recommends nuclear research.
        <li> <strong>1940</strong> - Einstein becomes a citizen of the United States but also retains his Swiss citizenship.
